# AMD Optimizing CPU Libraries FFI bindings

This crate contains AOCL (AMD Optimizing CPU Libraries) FFI bindings.

Current FFI version is [AOCL 5.1](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/aocl.html), where codes are available in github organization [amd](https://github.com/amd). If you are using an older version of AOCL, this crate should still work if you do not explicitly call the function that only occurs in higher version of BLIS.

> **Feature Not Complete**: AOCL is a large collection of math functions. This crate currently only have following bindgens:
> - blis (for blas, cblas utilities)
> - flame (for cblas, lapack, lapacke utilities)
>
> We surely want to perform more bindgens (such as fftw, etc.) in future; but these are not of priority for project REST and RSTSR. If you wish to put these bindgens in this crate, currently you can file an issue, and we will quickly realize the bindgen of other features in AOCL.

This crate is not official bindgen project. It is originally intended to serve rust tensor toolkit [RSTSR](https://github.com/RESTGroup/rstsr) and rust electronic structure toolkit [REST](https://gitee.com/RESTGroup/rest).

- **Audience**: Anyone uses AOCL function may also find it useful, not only RSTSR or REST program developers.
- **Pure Extern or Dynamic Loading**: This crate supports either pure extern (usual FFI, requires dynamic or static linking) and dynamic-loading, by cargo feature `dynamic_loading`.

## Dynamic loading

This crate supports dynamic loading by default.

If you do not want to use dynamic loading, please disable default cargo features (`--no-default-features` when cargo build).

The dynamic loading will try to find proper library when your program initializes.
- This crate will automatically detect proper libraries, if these libraries are in environmental path `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux) `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Mac OS), `PATH` (Windows).
- If you want to override the library to be loaded, please set these shell environmental variable `RSTSR_DYLOAD_AOCL_BLIS`, `RSTSR_DYLOAD_AOCL_FLAME` to the dynamic library path.

**NOTE**: When you call BLAS and LAPACK functions with dynamic loading, please **DO NOT USE** other crates (such as `rstsr_lapack_ffi`). Please make sure you are only using `rstsr_aocl_ffi::blis`, `rstsr_aocl_ffi::flame`. Sticking to using `rstsr_aocl_ffi` will make sure you are calling BLAS and LAPACK functions from AOCL, instead of other BLAS vendors.

If you encountered large compile time or disk consumption, you may consider add these lines in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[profile.dev.package.rstsr-aocl-ffi]
opt-level = 0
debug = false
```

## Cargo features

Default features:

- `dynamic_loading`: Supports dynamic loading.
- `blis`: Include BLIS bindgens.
- `flame`: Include LAPACK bindgens.

Optional features:

- `ilp64`: Use `int64_t` for dimension specification, or lapack error code types if this feature specified. Otherwise, use `int32_t`.
    - Please note that in module `blas`, error code is returned by `c_int`; in module `cblas`, BLIS utility functions use `c_int` for input or output.

## Crate structure

- `header`: Header files copied (or renamed) from original source.
- `scripts`: Script to generate FFI bindgens.
- In each bindgens, the following files are usually automatically generated by scripts:
    - `ffi_base.rs`: Basic type, enum, struct definitions.
    - `ffi_extern.rs`: Unsafe extern "C" bindgen functions. Only activated when not dynamic loading.
    - `dyload_struct.rs`: Struct `Lib` for dynamic loading.
    - `dyload_initializer.rs`: The initialization function of `Lib` for dynamic loading.
    - `dyload_compatible.rs`: Unsafe bindgen function that is compatible to that of `ffi_extern.rs`. Only activated when dynamic loading.
    - special case of `cblas::ffi_base`: the enums `CBLAS_TRANSPOSE`, `CBLAS_UPLO`, etc comes from crate `rstsr_lapack_ffi` for convenience. This crate depends on `rstsr_lapack_ffi` for those definitions of enums.

## Changelog

- v0.1.1

    - **API Breaking**: Change CBLAS enum definition to crate `rstsr-cblas-base`.
